1. whats the base address of AHB1 BUS peripheral registers?
	pg.65 - 0x4002 0000
2. whats the base address of GPIOA registers?
	0x4002 0000
3. whats the base address of RCC engine registers of the MCU?
	0x4002 3800
4. whats the base address of APB1 peripheral registers?
	0x4000 0000
5. whats the base address of flash memory?
	pg 75. 0x0800 0000
6. What's the base address of SRAM2?
	SRAM1 starts from 0x2000 0000
	SIZE of SRAM1 = X bytes
	base address of SRAM2 = 0x2000 0000 + X
	BASE_ADDRESS_OF_SRAM2 = BASE_ADDRESS_OF_SRAM1 + SIZE_OF_SRAM1
7. whats the base address of adc registers?
	pg 66. 0x4001 2000
	
===========================================================


if the instructions are present in between the memory locations 0x0000 0000 to 0x1FFF FFFC then
the Cortex Processor will fetch the instructions using the ICODE interface.

if the instructions are present outside of 0x0000 0000 to 0x01FFF FFFC then processor fetches the instructions
over the system bus.

if the data is present in between locations 0x0000 0000 to 0x1FFF FFFF, then processor fetches 
the data over D-CODE bus interface.

if the data is present outside 0x0000 0000 to 0x1FFF FFFF memory locations then, the data will be fetches
over the system bus.
